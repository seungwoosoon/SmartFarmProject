Our project is to create a smart farm that can monitor the growth environment in real time based on sensor data and improve crop productivity through automatic control

In addition, we would like to use ai to provide more differentiated services
It detects physiological inhibitions and diseases of plants through images and informs users of them so that crops can be easily managed
Based on environmental data, the growth of plants is predicted, and information on growth is visualized through digital twins to provide information to users
